## Introduction
This project provides a Python implementation of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for structural analysis, focusing on bar elements and nodes. The implementation includes classes for nodes, bar elements, and the overall structure. This README serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the provided code.
___

## Features
- Every structure is made up of elements and every element is made up of nodes.
- Nodes are endpoints of elements

There are three avaliable elements but only frames fully work as the other two can be define as frames
